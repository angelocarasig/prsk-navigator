# **Project Sekai Navigator**

Last Updated: 7th March 2023

----
## **About**
This project ideally lets users navigate around Project Sekai JP easier through this simulated 'translated' experience (the extent of this translation is DeepL, Google Translate and my own understandings).

----
## **To-Do List (Buttons):**
- ~~Main Page~~
- Menu

TBD

----
## **To-Do List (Others):**
- Sidebar with some quick-access links (Gameplay / Logging / Useful Tips etc.)
- Smoother animation transitions between pages
- Adjustable screen sizes (maybe granblue approach)

----
Also feel free to add me on JP: 5910890222915597
