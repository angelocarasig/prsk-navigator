# **Project Sekai Navigator**

Last Updated: 7th March 2023

----
## **About**
This project ideally lets users navigate around Project Sekai JP easier through this simulated 'translated' experience (the extent of this translation is DeepL, Google Translate and my own understandings).

You can view the project page [here](https://angelocarasig.github.io/prsk-navigator/)

----
## **To-Do List (Buttons):**
- ~~Main Page~~
- Menu

TBD

----
## **To-Do List (Others):**
- Sidebar with some quick-access links (Gameplay / Logging / Useful Tips etc.)
- Smoother animation transitions between pages
- Adjustable screen sizes (maybe granblue approach)
